SOME RULES:- (In React)
1.function name is always  start in uppercase letter
2.we create the new file by using .jsx extension or .js extension both.

NOTE=> For understanding when we write html code in our function then we use .jsx and when we write javascript code in our function then we use .js extension



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
